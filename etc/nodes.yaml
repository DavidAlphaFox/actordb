# List of all actordb nodes. Default rpc port is 4380, default ip is 127.0.0.1
nodes:
- testnd@127.0.0.1:44381
#- node2@192.168.1.2  %implies port 44380
#- node3@192.168.1.3:4381
#- node4@192.168.1.4:4382


# Nodes need to be organized into groups. 
# Groups of type cluster are actordb data nodes.
# Groups of other types will be able to communicate with cluster nodes, 
#  but will not hold actordb data. They can be used as incremental backup nodes (coming soon), 
#  client connection gateways and transaction managers. 
groups:
- name: grp1
  nodes: [testnd]
  type: cluster
#- name: grp2
#  nodes: [node2,node3,node4]
#  type: cluster
